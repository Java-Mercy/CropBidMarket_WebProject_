# CropBidMarket_WebProject_
This project solves two major problems:      Farmers struggle to afford expensive machinery.   Farmers do not get fair prices for their crops due to middlemen.   By combining the Equipment Rental Platform and Crop Bidding Marketplace, we create a single platform that helps farmers rent equipment and sell crops via bidding to get the best prices.
